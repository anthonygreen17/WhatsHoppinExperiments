Experiment #1:    Good
	- Get API token
	- Make API requests to BreweryDB
	- figure out what paths we will use in the application

	- figure out how much data we need to store
		- possibly, figure out how to put JSON on disk with Elixir



Experiment #2:    Good
	- JS Websockets
		- figure out how to structure channels
			- "updates/brewery/{brewery.name}"
			- "updates/beer/{beer.name}"





Potential Ideas:

	Experiment:
		- render data into the form that we want
		- do we want to take in JSON from API calls and put them into a database?

	Experiment:
		- figure out how to use search bar
		- figure out how to index what ur looking at(maybe by first letter?)


Other notes:

	- use a forum style where messages are saved forever, with reference to user
	- 


get a certain category:
http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/category/5/?key=KEY

get all categories:


Findings:

	- we cant do a GET to all beers (/beers). To get around that, we should have the following structure:
	- Category:
		- Style:
			- Beer:

	every beer has a style, every style has a category, and a GET to /categories is legal. Boom.




	Database stuff:

	Beer Table:
